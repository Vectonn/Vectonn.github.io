        <p>Sticky Fingers is a 2D top-down shooter heist game based on breaking into locations, grabbing as much loot as possible, and quickly making an escape back home. It is still a work in progress as of now (20/11/2024) but will be releasing in the form of a demo soon.</p>
        <p>Below are a few GIFs of the current state of gameplay. All of the core features are implemented, I am now working on getting as much content into the game as possible while polishing what's there. </p>
