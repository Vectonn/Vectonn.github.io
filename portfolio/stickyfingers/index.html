        <p><strong>Sticky Fingers</strong> is a self-made 2D top-down shooter heist game where you break into locations, grab as much loot as possible, and make a quick escape back home.</p>
        <p>The game has a demo released on Itch.io. <br>Developed in Unity with C# for PC, it features:</p>  
        <p>
            Fast-paced 2D combat with a focus on pinpoint accuracy.<br>
            Quick, challenging levels with instant resets.<br>
            An adrenaline system designed to fuel non-stop action.<br>
            A physics-based looting system to ferry loot from one place to another.<br>
            Different types of weapons, all offering a unique playstyle.<br>
            Hand-drawn, doodle-inspired sprites and animations.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Below are a few GIFs of the current gameplay. With all of the core features implemented, I am now focused on adding content and polishing the game.</p>
