            <p>This is a small 'life simulator'/digital pet game similar to Tamagotchis and other virtual pet idle games. It was a short project put together in a few days as part of a weekend game jam with a few friends.</p>
            <p>This was primarily a way to introduce myself and become familiar with Godot for future projects. <br>Developed in Godot with GDScript for PC, it features:</p>  
            <p>
                Idle gameplay where you can check back periodically to see how your pet's doing.<br>
                Happiness and hunger systems for your pet.<br>
                Cleaning your pet's room to ensure they stay happy. (Currently represented by a placeholder sprite.)<br>
                An economy based on cleaning your pet's room.<br>
                A variety of food to feed your pet, each with different costs and hunger replenishment.<br>
            </p>
