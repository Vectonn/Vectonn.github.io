<p> This blog will be covering the process of developing a top-down heist game as well as writing about the learning process behind it. It's inspired by games like Hotline Miami, the Payday series, and Heat Signature. The game will be created in Unity using C#, and will focus on fast-paced, action-oriented gameplay with a core gameplay loop that will involve breaking into various locations, getting as much loot as possible, and quickly making an escape. It will likely feature loud explosive gameplay rather than stealth, and may include either wave-based combat or precisely placed enemies depending on the scope of the project. </p>

<p> To begin with, I wanted to fast-track a demo as soon as possible. To achieve this, I focused on creating fluid 2D movement. I started by using the transform of the object, but later switched to using Rigidbodies as the player was able to push through walls. The player initially jittered when moving along walls, but was easily fixed by moving the player within the physics update within Unity (FixedUpdate) instead of every frame (Update). The box collider on the place was changed to a circle during this to mimic the final product better. </p>

<p> After this my next objective was to make the player face the mouse as they move around to allow for them to fight while moving. </p>
